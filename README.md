# About Me
My name is Ari, and I'm a young software engineer with a solid foundation in computer science and a passion for backend development. I am currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science at the Jerusalem College of Technology. My academic background has provided me with a deep understanding of object-oriented programming, algorithms, and data structures, primarily in C++ and Python.

#  Experience
I have  worked as a mentor in the "Impact" program, teaching object-oriented programming and C++ to teenagers. This role refined my ability to explain complex technical concepts, which is essential for collaborative work environments.

My military service as a combat soldier in the IDF taught me the importance of teamwork, leadership, and perseverance. These soft skills are vital in tech projects, which often require coordinated efforts.

I am fluent in Hebrew and Spanish, with advanced proficiency in English, enabling effective communication in diverse teams. My commitment to continuous learning keeps me updated with the latest backend technologies and best practices.
